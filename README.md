The Infinite War II (Online) - Back to Dark
=========================

Side Project.
An Online Multi-Player FPS game based on C#, Unity3D and Photon.
This is the multi-player version thus the robots are dettached.
Please have your friends playing on other PCs at the same time so that you can battle with them.

Implemented:(Ordered from basic to advanced)
* C# Object-Oriented-Develop Scripts 
* Basic uGUI for both PC and Android platform
* Travis-ci Automative Integration
* Physics & Graphics and Audio Controllers
* Geographic system: Terrain
* Animation system: Mecanim
* Game Manager
* Particle System & Line Renderer
* Inverse Kinematic
* Lighting, Shader and Image Effect
* Performance Analyzer: Profiler -> CPU Optimization, Animation Optimization and Memory Optimization
* Photon Unity Networking(PUN) and Photon Server



Requirements
------------

* Unity3D (if problem occurs while compiling, try my verison 5.3.1f)
* https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?thank-you=update&download_nid=24110&os=Win
* Photon Server SDK https://www.photonengine.com/zh-CN/Download/Photon-Server-SDK_v3-4-31-10808.exe
* Photon Unity Networking (Free Version)
* Photon Server Engine https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/1786
* C# IDE (Microsoft Visual Studio or MonoDevelop(I prefer this for Unity3D projects))
* PC or Android phones

That's all. Game design is not easy but fairly interesting and worth the efforts!
